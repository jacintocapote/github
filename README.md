## Install

You need to add a third party via composer. The steps for install this module is:
  * Add to composer.json (root folder) on the block extra the next code:
    ```yml
            "require": [
              "modules/custom/github/composer.json"
            ]      
    ```


NOTE: modules/custom is a example path but you can use another path. See https://www.drupal.org/node/2822349 for more info.
